## Why ngx-twcss?

It was a beautiful sunny morning, sitting at my well-lit desk, with my hot cup of coffee right next to it, I was starting a new Angular project, in which I had decided to use a fascinating library of CSS utility classes, discovered some days before. I didn't want to use these classes directly in my templates as indicated in the doc. I wanted to write 'clean' code. So I started looking online. I was surprised! And even a little disappointed, to imagine that I was not going to be able to use these beautiful components styled with Tailwind CSS in my Angular project in a clean way as previewed in React and Vite samples. I wanted to go far and be faster building fascinating web UIs with Angular and Tailwind CSS. So I created Ngx-Twcss to achieve that.

## What is ngx-twcss?

[@ngx-twcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-twcss) is a free and open-source components library that use the power of <a href="https://angular.dev/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">Tailwind CSS</a> to help you build fascinating web UIs faster and easier.
