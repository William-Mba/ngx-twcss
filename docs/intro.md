# Why ngx-twcss?
One day, I was starting a project in which l wanted to use Tailwind CSS components. At that time, there was no implementation of Tailwind CSS components available for Angular, so l created ngx-twcss to quickly integrate Tailwind CSS components into my Angular project.

# What is ngx-twcss?

A free and open-source components library crafted with <a href="https://angular.dev/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">Tailwind CSS</a> to help you create beautiful and modern web UIs faster and easier.
